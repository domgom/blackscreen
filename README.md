# Blackscreen
A black screen html page to be used as a screen saver in macOS through Safari's PWA "Add to dock.." feature. 

Great for keeping your OLED pixels from burning.

## Usage
- Open [this page](https://rawcdn.githack.com/domgom/blackscreen/d9a7e833c0adb4eeac783b3b850f77e99bf33118/index.html) in Safari. ( Or https://raw.githack.com/domgom/blackscreen/main/index.html for the no-CDN version).

- Safari menu: File / Add to dock..

- Select your app name, eg: 'Screensaver'.

- Your app should be now visible in the dock:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/domgom/blackscreen/main/screenshot.png" />
</p>

- When clicking on any part of the screen (except the README link) it will go full screen hiding the mouse cursor.

- When done, 'Esc' key will come back from fullscreen.
